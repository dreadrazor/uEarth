No installation is required.

Alternation between the GUI and the 3D view is done using the TAB key.
Movement in the 3D view is done using the mouse to look and the WASD keys.
Clicking a creature will select it (red arrow above it).
A blue arrow indicates where the creature is going.
If the red and blue arrow coincide then the creature is in the 'idle' state.
